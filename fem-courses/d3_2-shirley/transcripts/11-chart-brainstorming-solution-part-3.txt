>> Speaker 1: One of the things that I tried to do is, after I take a look at the chart, I tried to jot down some thoughts, some notes of what might be interesting, so that after all of the data exploration, when I'm trying to come up with a summary, or a message that I'm trying to communicate it's easier to go through all of my exploration and figure out what might be interesting.

[00:00:26]
So for this one, let's kinda list together like what interesting things jump out to you when you look at this?
>> Speaker 2: Like you said I think those outliers are interesting. Like most of the points all kind of generally together and then there's a few movies that are just through the roof better on both scores and wins.

[00:00:55]
So can we categorize those movies somehow?
>> Speaker 1: Most movies are clustered together, but there are some outliers with 200 plus wins and almost 100% score. So then the thought process is, can we figure out categories, like figure out their genres, what movies are they? What are their genres?

[00:01:27]
Kind of further exploration into that and that would be really fun. Maybe it's that I think maybe from here what might be other interesting exploration is looking at only those above 80 or only looking at those below 80. And then, just because right now it's great to be able to see this trend, but then all of the things below 80 are getting really squished, but if we only look at those, or even only the ones below let's say 70 and under 50 award wins.

[00:02:05]
And then you can kind of see the correlation there a lot better. Cuz it will open up and they will be less squished. I think that will be something I'll look into. Also look at movies that have 80% or more.
>> Speaker 1: Or only movies that have, let's say, 80% less than 70%, or something like that.

[00:02:32]
So those are further explorations I would that we could potentially do. We won't do it right now but I think if we are actually building something those are little insights and tangents that we will follow.
