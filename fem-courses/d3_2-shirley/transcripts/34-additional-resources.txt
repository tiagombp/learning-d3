>> Shirley Wu: So finally I want to give some resources. In terms of researching for this particular workshop, I counted these two books were especially helpful, so The Functional Art by Alberto Cairo and Visual Analysis and Design by Tamara Munzner. So both of them were really helpful in terms of kind of giving me a very organized approach to thinking about the design of visualization, as well as some resources online.

[00:00:36]
I mentioned before, the Datawrapper Blog has a lot of really great resources. Flowing Data has a newsletter that, just kind of, everyday, just gives you noteworthy visualizations. So that might be good to follow in terms of just getting inspiration and seeing what other people are doing with visualizations.

[00:01:02]
Andy Kirk has a blog series that's called The little of visualization design and this one just kinda picks out details. He doesn't talk about the overall visualization. He'll pick out one little detail in the visualization that he thinks was done really, really well and talk about why that's well.

[00:01:24]
And I really, really like that little focus on the details. And I think it's really important. I've talked about the pudding for visual storytelling, there's also the Information is Beautiful Awards, I'm looking at past winners for inspiration. I mean, I also was going to plug data sketches, which is the Project between Nadi and I.

[00:01:45]
And it's a bunch of different visualizations around different topics. And we've gotten feedback that people really, really like our process write up. So we'll talk about how we got the data, how we did the sketches and how we did the code. So I recommend that, too. And finally I want to thank all of these people.

[00:02:13]
I just realized I am a horrible person for spelling Lisa's name wrong, this might happen 2AM last night. But I want to thank Lisa Rost for a lot of the blog posts on data wrapper and Nadieh and Susie and Elijah for helping give me feedback for this workshop.

[00:02:33]
And all of my beautiful beta-testers that made sure the content for this was as good as possible. And I want to thank you Frontend Masters for letting me do this and putting up with almost a 12 hour workshop. [LAUGH] Just nine hours. Thank you so much. Thank you for letting me do this.
