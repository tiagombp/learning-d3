>> Shirley Wu: The last thing that I want to talk about with the design is this thing, remix and overlay. So my friend, Nadieh Bremer has a really great quote that I really like which is, you don't always need to start from scratch. You don't need to be creating a brand new custom data visualization that like nobody's ever seen before every single time.

[00:00:23]
A lot of times you can just remix what's out there already, like maybe it's just you see this a really great example of the D3 gallery. And maybe it's that none of these one thing help accomplish your goal of communicating your message. But maybe if you combine one or two of these together, that's the design you need to be able to get your point across.

[00:00:51]
So that's another thing I really like. But make sure that the right visuals to communicate your message. Don't just haphazardly be like, this is pretty, and this is pretty. And this would look pretty together, and like mash them together. Make sure that there's a reason, a rhyme and reason to why you're doing this.
