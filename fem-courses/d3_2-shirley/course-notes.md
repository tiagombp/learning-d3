# Introduction

> And I'm so excited about today, because originally I was considering doing something that was like advanced D3. But then as I thought a lot more about what an advanced D3 workshop would be, it felt like it would be kind of an enumerating and going through the D3 API. And maybe we'll build forest layouts in these different ways, we'll build trees in different ways or something. And I felt like that just wasn't as much of a productive use of our time, cuz I feel like that sort of thing just comes with practice. 

> The intuition of how to use different parts of the library and how to read the library documentation, etc, just comes with practice.
